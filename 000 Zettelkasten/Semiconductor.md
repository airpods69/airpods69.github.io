## About Semiconductors
- A material which has an electrical conductivity between insulator and conductor.

## Basic Properties of Semiconductors
- Resistivity decreases with increase in temperture.
- The mass action law: $n*p=n_{i}^{2}$
- Assume the substrate doping concentration to be $N_A$ then $p_{n0} \cong \frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_A}$ and $p_{p0} \cong N_A$.
