- Negative voltage is applied to gate electrode in [[Metal Oxide Semiconductor).
	- Holes get attracted to semiconductor-oxide surface.
	- Majority carrier concentration is more than the equilibrium hole concentration (Electron concentration (Minority) decreases as it is pushed deeper into substrate).
	- Oxide electric field is directed towards gate electrode.
	- Energy bands bend upwards near the surface (Energy needed Increases).
