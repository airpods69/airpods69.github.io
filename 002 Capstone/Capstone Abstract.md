# Abstract


Neuro-Degenerative diseases affects millions of people worldwide. It is the progressive loss of structure or functioning of the neurons. There is no known way for reversing this process of degeneration so these kinds of diseases are considered incurable. The [[Cerebral Cortex]] is the largest part of the brain which is responsible for the voluntary tasks like decision making and memory. Alzheimer's disease, in which the neurons in the [[Cerebral Cortex]] get affected, is the most common type of ND disease and currently, is ranked as the seventh leading cause of death in the United States of America.
Another Neuro-Degenerative disease, Parkinson's disease, which targets the motor system of the body, is estimated to have affected nearly 90,000 people each year in the United States alone according to a 2022 Parkinson's Foundation Study. There are many other such diseases which hinder with the neurological "settings" of the Cerebellum.
[[Motor Neuron Disease]] (MND) is a group of rare neuro-degenerative disorders that selectively effect motor neurons (The cells that control voluntary muscles of the body). [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]] (ALS), Parkinson's Disease and [[Spinal Muscular Atrophy]] (SMA) are few of the diseases/disorders which belong to this group. Just like in Parkinson's Disease, [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]] is a disease in which the motor neurons are selectively targeted for degeneration and negatively impacts the Upper Motor Neurons and Lower Motor Neurons. In [[Spinal Muscular Atrophy]], the motor neurons are targeted and killed. Without these motor neurons, muscles cannot receive signals from the brain for motor movements. Most of the Neuro-Degenerative diseases are idiopathic which makes it challenging to develop a cure. The people who got affected by Neuro-Degenerative diseases are stripped off a normal life and cannot get back to living normally without any cure.
The project aims to help the patients affected from Motor Neuron Diseases to perform translational motion without the help from an external volunteer. A subject who is affected from MNDs is still aware of their environment since [[Cerebral Cortex]] is functioning properly. The electrical signals from the [[Cerebral Cortex]] will be recorded via Electroencephalogram (EEG) device (EMotive) and classified into the direction which the subject wants to perform translational motion in. There are many factors which will affect the decision making of the model like unwanted thoughts from the subject and involuntary actions like eye blinking. Dealing with these factors for robust classification will be a major challenge for the project.
