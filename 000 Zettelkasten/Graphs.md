## Graphs
 - Collection of vertices connected to each other through a set of edges.
 - A more formal definition would be:
	 - A graph is defined as an ordered pair of a set of vertices and a set of edges. $$G = (V, E)$$ Here, V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges connecting the vertices.
