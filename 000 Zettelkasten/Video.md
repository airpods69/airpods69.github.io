- **Video** -> Pictorial (visual) information including still and time-varying images.
- **Still Images** -> Spatial distribution of intensity which remains constant with time.
- **Time-Varying Images** -> Spatial distribution of intensity is not constant with time.
- A time-varying image is a spatio-temporal intensity pattern which can be denoted by $s_c(x_1, x_2, t)$ where $x_1$, $x_2$ are spatial parameters and $t$ is temporal parameter.
- Video were traditionally recorded and sent in the form of [[Analog Video).
