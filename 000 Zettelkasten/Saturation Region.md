- For $V_{DS} = V_{DSAT}$
	- Inversion charge at drain is reduced to zero -> Pitch Off point.
- For $V_{DS} > V_{DSAT}$
	- A depleted surface region forms adjacent to drain.
	- Further increase in $V_{DS}$ causes increase in depletion region. -> Towards source.
	- Channel end remains constant and equal to $V_{DSAT}$.
