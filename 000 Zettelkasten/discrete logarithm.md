- In mathematics, for given real numbers a and b, the logarithm $log_b a$ is a number x such that $b^x = a$. Analogously, in any group G, powers $b^k$ can be defined for all integers k, and the discrete logarithm $log_b a$ is an integer k such that $b^k = a$. In number theory, the more commonly used term is index: we can write $x = ind_r a (mod m)$ (read "the index of a to the base r modulo m") for $r^x ≡ a (\text{mod } m)$ if $r$ is a primitive root of m and $gcd(a,m) = 1$.

- Discrete logarithms are quickly computable in a few special cases. However, no efficient method is known for computing them in general. Several important algorithms in public-key cryptography, such as ElGamal base their security on the assumption that the discrete logarithm problem over carefully chosen groups has no efficient solution.
