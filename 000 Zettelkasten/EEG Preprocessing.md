Scalp Precipitation produces artificats at lower frequencies, 0.5 kHz ish -> can be removed using a bandpass filter.

Power line intereference can be removed by using a notch filter

Another frequent cause of non-physiological artifact is electrode artifact due to
the poor placement of electrode on the scalp. When an electrode moves and the
electric double layer is disturbed, it would create a DC potential similar to
discharging a capacitor (Barlow 1986), and the characteristic electrode “pop” occurs.

Amplifier “noise” is caused by thermal agitation of electrons
in the amplifier circuits

Digital artifacts include aliasing (inadequate sampling rate),
errors in analog to digital conversion, skew errors, multiplexing artifacts, and
blocking (Blum 1998).
