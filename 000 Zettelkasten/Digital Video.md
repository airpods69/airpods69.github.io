- **Digital Video** is a representation of natural videos sampled both __spatially__ and __temporally__ (Multi-Dimensional).
- **Frame**: Scene typically sampled at a point in time which represents the complete visual scene.

 - Benefits of Digital Representation of Videos
	 1. Existence of video at different properties like multiple spatial and temporal resolutions and different bit rates.
	 2. Variable rate transmission on demand.
	 3. Easy software conversion.
	 4. Ease of encryption.
