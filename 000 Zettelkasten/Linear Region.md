- Substrate potential is kept lower than the other three terminal potentials to ensure that [[p-n junctions) are reverse biased initially.
- When $V_{GS} > V_{TO}$
	- Conduction channel formed.
	- Drain Current starts to flow.
	- When $V_{DS} = 0$
		- $I_{D} = 0$
	- When $V_{DS} > 0$ and small
		- $I_D$ is proportional to $V_{DS}$
		- Current flows from S to D.
		- Channel acts as voltage controlled resistor.
		- Electron velocity much lower than drift velocity limit.
