- Compact Neural Network for EEG based BCI.
- "We introduce the use of [depthwise and separable convolutions](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-basic-introduction-to-separable-convolutions-b99ec3102728) to construct an EEG-specific model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI".
- "We fit the model using the Adam optimizer minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss function".

Overall visualization of the EEGNet architecture. Lines denote the convolutional kernel connectivity between inputs and outputs (calledÂ _feature maps_). The network starts with a temporal convolution (second column) to learn frequency filters, then uses a depthwise convolution (middle column), connected to each feature map individually, to learn frequency-specific spatial filters. The separable convolution (fourth column) is a combination of a depthwise convolution, which learns a temporal summary for each feature map individually, followed by a pointwise convolution, which learns how to optimally mix the feature maps together. Full details about the network architecture can be found in table 2.
