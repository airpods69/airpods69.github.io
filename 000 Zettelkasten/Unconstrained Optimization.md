Cost function : $C(\omega)$ which is differentiable wrt to $\omega$.
Objective: Find optimal solution such that $$C(\omega*) \ge C(\omega)$$ where $\omega*$ is optimal weights.

For minima, $\nabla C(\omega*) = 0$ and $\nabla = [\delta/\delta \omega_1, \delta/\delta \omega_2, ..., \delta/\delta \omega_n]$

For convergence, $$C(\omega(n + 1)) \ge C(\omega(n))$$
