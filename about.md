### What do I work with?

#### Latest
My latest interest is in Vulkan programming using Rust language and my goal is to create an accelerated mathematical library using that. Let's see how that boat sails.

#### Past
I work with almost anything. My recent works were related to Large Language Models and Backend Development. I was also dealing with software architecture related stuff so thats a hat I have put on.
