Happens in the [[Cerebral Cortex).

# Event Related Desynchronization
ERD oscillations occurs when MI is performed which causes the mu and beta bands to exhibit decreased amplitudes.

# Event Related Synchronization
When MI is completed, the energy in beta band increases, this is known as Event Related Synchronization(ERS).
