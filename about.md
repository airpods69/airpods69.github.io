## Who am I?

I am Varenyam Bhardwaj (aka Airpods69). I like to drink coffee and convert the caffeine into code.

> A coffee machine close to me will keep the project working in production.

## What do I do?
Most of my time is spent programming backend logic or AI related stuff which includes training or just using pre-existing models. It really depends on the task at hand.

I was an intern at [RediMinds Inc.](https://rediminds.com) (Check those guys out) and now I am a cybersecurity intern at Disney Star.


### Latest
My latest interest is in Vulkan programming using Rust language and my goal is to create an accelerated mathematical library using that. Let's see how that boat sails. Learning this for developing a personal framework for GPU accelerated maths with a vulkan background.

### Past
I work with almost anything. My recent works were related to Large Language Models and Backend Development. I was also dealing with software architecture related stuff so thats a hat I have put on.
