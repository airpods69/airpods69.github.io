Evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about population to determine which statement is best supported by sample data.

## Parameters for Hypothesis Testing.
1. Null Hypothesis ($H_o$): General statement with no relationship between measured cases. (Typically written with (=) to indicate no difference.)
2. Alternative Hypothesis($H_a$): Contrary to Null Hypothesis.
3. Level of Significance($\alpha$): Refers to degree of significance in which we accept or reject Null Hypothesis.
4. p-value or Calculated Probabilities: Probability of finding observed results when $H_o$ is true. if $p < \alpha$: reject, else accept Null Hypothesis.
5. Z-score: 
	- $z_{\text{calculated}} = \frac{\bar x - \mu_o}{\frac{SD}{\sqrt n}}$
	-  To find $z_\text{critical}$, what we need to do is subtract $\alpha$ from $1$ to get confidence level. 
	- Plot that upar niche vala graph and find bichvale ka area after removing the sides (chotu sides hatenge).
	- Find the value of area in graph now.
