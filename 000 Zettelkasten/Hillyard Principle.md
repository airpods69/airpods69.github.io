It is inappropriate to assume that a small difference is too trivial to affect ERP results (Luck 2004). **According to Steven Hillyard, the best way to avoid physical stimulus confounds is to use exactly the same physical stimuli across different conditions**. This suggestion was named as “**Hillyard principle**” by Steven Luck, who hung it on his laboratory wall as a slogan (Luck 2014). An experiment that follows the Hillyard principle usually manipulates the meaning of stimuli via task instruction. For instance, participants might be provided with an asterisk (“�”) as outcome feedback during a gambling task. In one condition, participants are told that the asterisk indicates that they win (or lose) in the current trial; in another condition, the asterisk indicates that the real outcome (win/loss) is unknowable to participants (i.e., ambiguous outcome). Using this task design, researchers could assume that the comparison of ERPs elicited by the asterisk between the two conditions reveals the difference in cognitive processing between unambiguous and ambiguous information. However, the Hillyard principle could only be applied in limited cases. In many studies which are theoretically important, it is necessary to use different stimuli across conditions. For instance, researchers may be interested in the processing of different pictures varied in emotional valence (positive vs. negative). In this case, physical stimulus confounds might be unavoid- able (although one can still normalize some of the basic physical properties of pictures), but we may demonstrate that they are actually not responsible for the between-condition difference of [[ERP) measures with additional data analyses or experiments (Luck 2004).
