- Increased positive gate bias
	- Increases surface potential which increases the downwards bending of energy bands.
	- Mid Gap energy level $E_i$ becomes smaller than Fermi Level $E_{F_p}$ on surface.
		- Substrate now acts like n-type.
		- Electron density higher than majority hole density.
	- Surface is said to be ***inverted*** when:
		- Density of mobile electrons on surface becomes equal to density of holes in the bulk substrate.
		- Further increase in gate voltage leads to an increase in electron concentration but not to an increase in depletion depth.
